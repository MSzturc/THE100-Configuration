# THE100-Configruation

In this repository you find the configuration for all of T100 / T250 builds. The configuration is modular and it was inspired by Klippain and RatOS configuration.

It offers the following features:
- TEST_RESONANCES: Automatically determines the center of the print bed
- Adaptive Bed Mesh Support: This feature dynamically adjusts the bed mesh to the positions where printing actually occurs.
